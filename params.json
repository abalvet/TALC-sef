{"name":"Talc-sef","tagline":"TALC-sef is a pos-TAgged Literary Corpus, in Serbian, English and French developed at Université d'Artois and Université Lille 3. ","body":"# Welcome to TALC-sef\r\n## What is TALC-sef?\r\nTALC-sef stands for pos-TAgged Literary Corpus, in Serbian, English and French.\r\nThis page links to the associated github repository, in which you'll find pos-tagging models for Serbian, based on a 100,000 tokens manually revised reference corpus.\r\nTagging models are available for BTagger, TnT and Treetagger. The best tagger is BTagger, but the optimal speed/accuracy compromise is TnT.\r\nTagging models are for pos-tagging only: no lemmatization! Tags are based on a tagset aiming at a trade-off between accuracy and grammatical precision. In other words, it stands between the >900 tags from the CesANA corpus (G. Orwell's _1984_ translation into Serbian), used in (Gesmundo and Samardzic, 2012), and Popovic's 16 tags tagsets.\r\n\r\nResources are provided for academic research. \r\nWe've put a lot of effort into this, but, as always, glitches are inevitable here and there. We'll do our best to correct any errors in future versions.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA. Balvet\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
