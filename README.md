TALC-sef
========

TALC-sef is a pos-TAgged Literary Corpus, in Serbian, English and French developed at Université d'Artois and Université Lille 3. 

In this corpus, >830,000 Serbian tokens were tagged with BTagger (Gesmundo & Samardzic, 2012), based on a reference corpus of >100,000 manually revised tokens. Tagging accuracy, with our ad hoc tagset (43 tags), and without lemmatization, is over 94% on average.

The corpus is described in our paper: http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/summaries/755.html.
